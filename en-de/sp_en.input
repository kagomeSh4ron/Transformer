Thank you so much, Chris.
And it's truly a great honor to have the opportunity to come to this stage twice; I'm extremely grateful.
I have been blown away by this conference, and I want to thank all of you for the many nice comments about what I had to say the other night.
And I say that sincerely, partly because  I need that.
Put yourselves in my position.
I flew on Air Force Two for eight years.
Now I have to take off my shoes or boots to get on an airplane!
I'll tell you one quick story to illustrate what that's been like for me.
It's a true story -- every bit of this is true.
Soon after Tipper and I left the --  White House --  we were driving from our home in Nashville to a little farm we have 50 miles east of Nashville.
Driving ourselves.
I know it sounds like a little thing to you, but --  I looked in the rear-view mirror and all of a sudden it just hit me.
There was no motorcade back there.
You've heard of phantom limb pain?
This was a rented Ford Taurus.
It was dinnertime, and we started looking for a place to eat.
We were on I-40. We got to Exit 238, Lebanon, Tennessee.
We got off the exit, we found a Shoney's restaurant.
Low-cost family restaurant chain, for those of you who don't know it.
We went in and sat down at the booth, and the waitress came over, made a big commotion over Tipper.  She took our order, and then went to the couple in the booth next to us, and she lowered her voice so much, I had to really strain to hear what she was saying.
And she said "Yes, that's former Vice President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper."
And the man said, "He's come down a long way, hasn't he?"
There's been kind of a series of epiphanies.
The very next day, continuing the totally true story, I got on a G-V to fly to Africa to make a speech in Nigeria, in the city of Lagos, on the topic of energy.
And I began the speech by telling them the story of what had just happened the day before in Nashville.
And I told it pretty much the same way I've just shared it with you: Tipper and I were driving ourselves, Shoney's, low-cost family restaurant chain, what the man said -- they laughed.
I gave my speech, then went back out to the airport to fly back home.
I fell asleep on the plane until, during the middle of the night, we landed on the Azores Islands for refueling.
I woke up, they opened the door, I went out to get some fresh air, and I looked, and there was a man running across the runway.
And he was waving a piece of paper, and he was yelling, "Call Washington! Call Washington!"
And I thought to myself, in the middle of the night, in the middle of the Atlantic, what in the world could be wrong in Washington?
Then I remembered it could be a bunch of things.
was that my staff was extremely upset because one of the wire services in Nigeria had already written a story about my speech, and it had already been printed in cities all across the United States of America.
It was printed in Monterey, I checked.
And the story began, "Former Vice President Al Gore announced in Nigeria yesterday," quote: 'My wife Tipper and I have opened a low-cost family restaurant'" -- "'named Shoney's, and we are running it ourselves.'" Before I could get back to U.S. soil, David Letterman and Jay Leno had already started in on -- one of them had me in a big white chef's hat, Tipper was saying, "One more burger with fries!"
Three days later, I got a nice, long, handwritten letter from my friend and partner and colleague Bill Clinton, saying, "Congratulations on the new restaurant, Al!"
We like to celebrate each other's successes in life.
I was going to talk about information ecology.
But I was thinking that, since I plan to make a lifelong habit of coming back to TED, that maybe I could talk about that another time.
Chris Anderson: It's a deal!
Al Gore: I want to focus on what many of you have said you would like me to elaborate on: What can you do about the climate crisis?
I want to start with a couple of -- I'm going to show some new images, and I'm going to recapitulate just four or five.
Now, the slide show. I update the slide show every time I give it.
I add new images, because I learn more about it every time I give it. It's like beach-combing, you know?
Every time the tide comes in and out, you find some more shells.
Just in the last two days, we got the new temperature records in January.
This is just for the United States of America.
Historical average for Januarys is 31 degrees; last month was 39.5 degrees.
Now, I know that you wanted some more bad news about the environment -- I'm kidding.
But these are the recapitulation slides, and then I'm going to go into new material about what you can do.
But I wanted to elaborate on a couple of these.
First of all, this is where we're projected to go with the U.S. contribution to global warming, under business as usual.
Efficiency in end-use electricity and end-use of all energy is the low-hanging fruit.
Efficiency and conservation -- it's not a cost; it's a profit.
The sign is wrong.
It's not negative; it's positive.
These are investments that pay for themselves.
But they are also very effective in deflecting our path.
Cars and trucks -- I talked about that in the slideshow, but I want you to put it in perspective.
It's an easy, visible target of concern -- and it should be -- but there is more global warming pollution that comes from buildings than from cars and trucks.
Cars and trucks are very significant, and we have the lowest standards in the world.
And so we should address that. But it's part of the puzzle.
Other transportation efficiency is as important as cars and trucks.
Renewables at the current levels of technological efficiency can make this much difference.
And with what Vinod, and John Doerr and others, many of you here -- there are a lot of people directly involved in this -- this wedge is going to grow much more rapidly than the current projection shows it.
Carbon Capture and Sequestration -- that's what CCS stands for -- is likely to become the killer app that will enable us to continue to use fossil fuels in a way that is safe.
Not quite there yet.
OK. Now, what can you do?
Reduce emissions in your home.
Most of these expenditures are also profitable.
Insulation, better design. Buy green electricity where you can.
I mentioned automobiles -- buy a hybrid.
Use light rail.
Figure out some of the other options that are much better. It's important.
Be a green consumer.
You have choices with everything you buy, between things that have a harsh effect, or a much less harsh effect on the global climate crisis.
Make a decision to live a carbon-neutral life.
Those of you who are good at branding, I'd love to get your advice and help on how to say this in a way that connects with the most people.
It is easier than you think. It really is.
A lot of us in here have made that decision, and it is really pretty easy.
It means reduce your carbon dioxide emissions with the full range of choices that you make, and then purchase or acquire offsets for the remainder that you have not completely reduced.
And what it means is elaborated at climatecrisis.net.
There is a carbon calculator.
Participant Productions convened -- with my active involvement -- the leading software writers in the world, on this arcane science of carbon calculation, to construct a consumer-friendly carbon calculator.
You can very precisely calculate what your CO2 emissions are, and then you will be given options to reduce.
And by the time the movie comes out in May, this will be updated to 2.0, and we will have click-through purchases of offsets.
Next, consider making your business carbon-neutral.
Again, some of us have done that, and it's not as hard as you think.
Integrate climate solutions into all of your innovations, whether you are from the technology, or entertainment, or design and architecture community.
Invest sustainably. Majora mentioned this.
Listen, if you have invested money with managers who you compensate on the basis of their annual performance, don't ever again complain about quarterly report CEO management.
Over time, people do what you pay them to do.
And if they judge how much they're going to get paid on your capital that they've invested, based on the short-term returns, you're going to get short-term decisions.
A lot more to be said about that.
Become a catalyst of change.
Teach others, learn about it, talk about it.
The movie is a movie version of the slideshow I gave two nights ago, except it's a lot more entertaining.
And it comes out in May.
Many of you here have the opportunity to ensure that a lot of people see it.
Consider sending somebody to Nashville. Pick well.
And I am personally going to train people to give this slideshow -- re-purposed, with some of the personal stories obviously replaced with a generic approach, and it's not just the slides, it's what they mean.
And it's how they link together.
And so I'm going to be conducting a course this summer for a group of people that are nominated by different folks to come and then give it en masse, in communities all across the country, and we're going to update the slideshow for all of them every single week, to keep it right on the cutting edge.
Working with Larry Lessig, it will be, somewhere in that process, posted with tools and limited-use copyrights, so that young people can remix it and do it in their own way.
Where did anybody get the idea that you ought to stay arm's length from politics?
It doesn't mean that if you're a Republican, that I'm trying to convince you to be a Democrat.
We need Republicans as well.
This used to be a bipartisan issue, and I know that in this group it really is.
Become politically active.
Make our democracy work the way it's supposed to work.
Support the idea of capping carbon dioxide emissions -- global warming pollution -- and trading it.
Here's why: as long as the United States is out of the world system, it's not a closed system.
Once it becomes a closed system, with U.S. participation, then everybody who's on a board of directors -- how many people here serve on the board of directors of a corporation?
Once it's a closed system, you will have legal liability if you do not urge your CEO to get the maximum income from reducing and trading the carbon emissions The market will work to solve this problem -- if we can accomplish this.
Help with the mass persuasion campaign that will start this spring.
We have to change the minds of the American people.
Because presently, the politicians do not have permission to do what needs to be done.
And in our modern country, the role of logic and reason no longer includes mediating between wealth and power the way it once did.
It's now repetition of short, hot-button, 30-second, 28-second television ads.
We have to buy a lot of those ads.
Let's re-brand global warming, as many of you have suggested.
I like "climate crisis" instead of "climate collapse," but again, those of you who are good at branding, I need your help on this.
Somebody said the test we're facing now, a scientist told me, is whether the combination of an opposable thumb and a neocortex is a viable combination.
That's really true.
I said the other night, and I'll repeat now: this is not a political issue.
Again, the Republicans here -- this shouldn't be partisan.
You have more influence than some of us who are Democrats do.
This is an opportunity.
Not just this, but connected to the ideas that are here, to bring more coherence to them.
We are one.
Thank you very much, I appreciate it.
In terms of invention, I'd like to tell you the tale of one of my favorite projects.
I think it's one of the most exciting that I'm working on, but I think it's also the simplest.
It's a project that has the potential to make a huge impact around the world.
It addresses one of the biggest health issues on the planet, the number one cause of death in children under five.
Which is ...? Water-borne diseases? Diarrhea? Malnutrition?
No. It's breathing the smoke from indoor cooking fires -- acute respiratory infections caused by this. Can you believe that?
I find this shocking and somewhat appalling.
Can't we make cleaner burning cooking fuels?
Can't we make better stoves?
How is it that this can lead to over two million deaths every year?
I know Bill Joy was talking to you about the wonders of carbon nanotubes, so I'm going to talk to you about the wonders of carbon macro-tubes, which is charcoal.
So this is a picture of rural Haiti. Haiti is now 98 percent deforested.
You'll see scenes like this all over the island.
It leads to all sorts of environmental problems and problems that affect people throughout the nation.
A couple years ago there was severe flooding that led to thousands of deaths -- that's directly attributable to the fact that there are no trees on the hills to stabilize the soil.
So the rains come -- they go down the rivers and the flooding happens.
Now one of the reasons why there are so few trees is this: people need to cook, and they harvest wood and they make charcoal in order to do it.
It's not that people are ignorant to the environmental damage.
They know perfectly well, but they have no other choice.
Fossil fuels are not available, and solar energy doesn't cook the way that they like their food prepared.
And so this is what they do.
You'll find families like this who go out into the forest to find a tree, cut it down and make charcoal out of it.
So not surprisingly, there's a lot of effort that's been done to look at alternative cooking fuels.
About four years ago, I took a team of students down to Haiti and we worked with Peace Corps volunteers there.
This is one such volunteer and this is a device that he had built in the village where he worked.
And the idea was that you could take waste paper; you could compress it and make briquettes that could be used for fuel.
But this device was very slow.
So our engineering students went to work on it and with some very simple changes, they were able to triple the throughput of this device.
So you could imagine they were very excited about it.
And they took the briquettes back to MIT so that they could test them.
And one of the things that they found was they didn't burn.
So it was a little discouraging to the students.
And in fact, if you look closely, right here you can see it says, "US Peace Corps."
As it turns out, there actually wasn't any waste paper in this village.
And while it was a good use of government paperwork for this volunteer to bring it back with him to his village, it was 800 kilometers away.
And so we thought perhaps there might be a better way to come up with an alternative cooking fuel.
What we wanted to do is we wanted to make a fuel that used something that was readily available on the local level.
You see these all over Haiti as well. They're small-scale sugar mills.
And the waste product from them after you extract the juice from the sugarcane is called "bagasse."
It has no other use.
It has no nutritional value, so they don't feed it to the animals.
It just sits in a pile near the sugar mill until eventually they burn it.
What we wanted to do was we wanted to find a way to harness this waste resource and turn it into a fuel that would be something that people could easily cook with, something like charcoal.
So over the next couple of years, students and I worked to develop a process.
So you start with the bagasse, and then you take a very simple kiln that you can make out of a waste fifty five-gallon oil drum.
After some time, after setting it on fire, you seal it to restrict the oxygen that goes into the kiln, and then you end up with this carbonized material here.
However, you can't burn this.
It's too fine and it burns too quickly to be useful for cooking.
So we had to try to find a way to form it into useful briquettes.
And conveniently, one of my students was from Ghana, and he remembered a dish his mom used to make for him called "kokonte," which is a very sticky porridge made out of the cassava root.
And so what we did was we looked, and we found that cassava is indeed grown in Haiti, under the name of "manioc."
In fact, it's grown all over the world -- yucca, tapioca, manioc, cassava, it's all the same thing -- a very starchy root vegetable.
And you can make a very thick, sticky porridge out of it, which you can use to bind together the charcoal briquettes.
So we did this. We went down to Haiti.
These are the graduates of the first Ecole de Charbon, or Charcoal Institute. And these --  That's right. So I'm actually an instructor at MIT as well as CIT.
And these are the briquettes that we made.
Now I'm going to take you to a different continent. This is India and this is the most commonly used cooking fuel in India. It's cow dung.
And more than in Haiti, this produces really smoky fires, and this is where you see the health impacts of cooking with cow dung and biomass as a fuel.
Kids and women are especially affected by it, because they're the ones who are around the cooking fires.
So we wanted to see if we could introduce this charcoal-making technology there.
Well, unfortunately, they didn't have sugarcane and they didn't have cassava, but that didn't stop us.
What we did was we found what were the locally available sources of biomass.
And there was wheat straw and there was rice straw in this area.
And what we could use as a binder was actually small amounts of cow manure, And we did side-by-side tests, and here you can see the charcoal briquettes and here the cow dung.
And you can see that it's a lot cleaner burning of a cooking fuel.
And in fact, it heats the water a lot more quickly.
And so we were very happy, thus far.
But one of the things that we found was when we did side-by-side comparisons with wood charcoal, it didn't burn as long.
And the briquettes crumbled a little bit and we lost energy as they fell apart as they were cooking.
So we wanted to try to find a way to make a stronger briquette so that we could compete with wood charcoal in the markets in Haiti.
So we went back to MIT, we took out the Instron machine and we figured out what sort of forces you needed in order to compress a briquette to the level that you actually are getting improved performance out of it?
And at the same time that we had students in the lab looking at this, we also had community partners in Haiti working to develop the process, to improve it and make it more accessible to people in the villages there.
And after some time, we developed a low-cost press that allows you to produce charcoal, which actually now burns not only -- actually, it burns longer, cleaner than wood charcoal.
So now we're in a situation where we have a product, which is actually better than what you can buy in Haiti in the marketplace, which is a very wonderful place to be.
In Haiti alone, about 30 million trees are cut down every year.
There's a possibility of this being implemented and saving a good portion of those.
In addition, the revenue generated from that charcoal is 260 million dollars.
That's an awful lot for a country like Haiti -- with a population of eight million and an average income of less than 400 dollars.
So this is where we're also moving ahead with our charcoal project.
And one of the things that I think is also interesting, is I have a friend up at UC Berkeley who's been doing risk analysis.
And he's looked at the problem of the health impacts of burning wood versus charcoal.
And he's found that worldwide, you could prevent a million deaths switching from wood to charcoal as a cooking fuel.
That's remarkable, but up until now, there weren't ways to do it without cutting down trees.
But now we have a way that's using an agricultural waste material to create a cooking fuel.
One of the really exciting things, though, is something that came out of the trip that I took to Ghana just last month.
And I think it's the coolest thing, and it's even lower tech than what you just saw, if you can imagine such a thing. Here it is.
So what is this? This is corncobs turned into charcoal.
And the beauty of this is that you don't need to form briquettes -- it comes ready made. This is my $100 laptop, right here.
And actually, like Nick, I brought samples.
So we can pass these around.
They're fully functional, field-tested, ready to roll out.
And I think one of the things which is also remarkable about this technology, is that the technology transfer is so easy. Compared to the sugarcane charcoal, where we have to teach people how to form it into briquettes and you have the extra step of cooking the binder, this comes pre-briquetted.
And this is about the most exciting thing in my life right now, which is perhaps a sad commentary on my life.
But once you see it, like you guys in the front row -- All right, yeah, OK. So anyway --  Here it is. And this is, I think, a perfect example of what Robert Wright was talking about in those non-zero-sum things.
So not only do you have health benefits, you have environmental benefits.
But this is one of the incredibly rare situations where you also have economic benefits.
People can make their own cooking fuel from waste products.
They can generate income from this.
They can save the money that they were going to spend on charcoal and they can produce excess and sell it in the market to people who aren't making their own.
It's really rare that you don't have trade-offs between health and economics, or environment and economics.
So this is a project that I just find extremely exciting and I'm really looking forward to see where it takes us.
So when we talk about, now, the future we will create, one of the things that I think is necessary is to have a very clear vision of the world that we live in.
And now, I don't actually mean the world that we live in.
I mean the world where women spend two to three hours everyday grinding grain for their families to eat.
I mean the world where advanced building materials means cement roofing tiles that are made by hand, and where, when you work 10 hours a day, you're still only earning 60 dollars in a month.
I mean the world where women and children spend 40 billion hours a year fetching water.
That's as if the entire workforce of the state of California worked full time for a year doing nothing but fetching water.
It's a place where, for example, if this were India, in this room, only three of us would have a car.
If this were Afghanistan, only one person in this room would know how the use the Internet.
If this were Zambia -- 300 of you would be farmers, 100 of you would have AIDS or HIV.
And more than half of you would be living on less than a dollar a day.
These are the issues that we need to come up with solutions for.
These are the issues that we need to be training our engineers, our designers, our business people, our entrepreneurs to be facing.
These are the solutions that we need to find.
I have a few areas that I believe are especially important that we address.
One of them is creating technologies to promote micro-finance and micro-enterprise, so that people who are living below the poverty line can find a way to move out -- and that they're not doing it using the same traditional basket making, poultry rearing, etc.
But there are new technologies and new products that they can make on a small scale.
The next thing I believe is that we need to create technologies for poor farmers to add value to their own crops.
And we need to rethink our development strategies, so that we're not promoting educational campaigns to get them to stop being farmers, but rather to stop being poor farmers.
And we need to think about how we can do that effectively.
We need to work with the people in these communities and give them the resources and the tools that they need to solve their own problems. That's the best way to do it.
We shouldn't be doing it from outside.
So we need to create this future, and we need to start doing it now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Thank you, incredible. Stay here. Tell us -- just while we see if someone has a question -- just tell us about one of the other things that you've worked on.
Amy Smith: Some of the other things we're working on are ways to do low-cost water quality testing, so that communities can maintain their own water systems, know when they're working, know when they treat them, etc.
We're also looking at low-cost water-treatment systems.
One of the really exciting things is looking at solar water disinfection and improving the ability to be able to do that.
CA: What's the bottleneck preventing this stuff getting from scale?
Do you need to find entrepreneurs, or venture capitalists, or what do you need to take what you've got and get it to scale?
AS: I think it's large numbers of people moving it forward. It's a difficult thing -- it's a marketplace which is very fragmented and a consumer population with no income.
So you can't use the same models that you use in the United States for making things move forward.
And we're a pretty small staff, which is me.
So, you know, I do what I can with the students.
We have 30 students a year go out into the field and try to implement this and move it forward.
The other thing is you have to do things with a long time frame, as, you know, you can't expect to get something done in a year or two years; you have to be looking five or 10 years ahead.
But I think with the vision to do that, we can move forward.
A public, Dewey long ago observed, is constituted through discussion and debate.
If we are to call the tyranny of assumptions into question, and avoid doxa, the realm of the unquestioned, then we must be willing to subject our own assumptions to debate and discussion. It is in this spirit that I join into a discussion of one of the critical issues of our time, namely, how to mobilize different forms of capital for the project of state building.
To put the assumptions very clearly: capitalism, after 150 years, has become acceptable, and so has democracy.
If we looked in the world of 1945 and looked at the map of capitalist economies and democratic polities, they were the rare exception, not the norm.
The question now, however, is both about which form of capitalism and which type of democratic participation. But we must acknowledge that this moment has brought about a rare consensus of assumptions.
And that provides the ground for a type of action, because consensus of each moment allows us to act. And it is necessary, no matter how fragile or how provisional our consensus, to be able to move forward.
But the majority of the world neither benefits from capitalism nor from democratic systems. Most of the globe experiences the state as repressive, as an organization that is concerned about denial of rights, rather than provision of it.
And in terms of experience of capitalism, there are two aspects that the rest of the globe experiences.
First, extractive industry.
Blood diamonds, smuggled emeralds, timber, that is cut right from under the poorest. Second is technical assistance.
And technical assistance might shock you, but it's the worst form of -- today -- of the ugly face of the developed world to the developing countries. Tens of billions of dollars are supposedly spent on building capacity with people who are paid up to 1,500 dollars a day, who are incapable of thinking creatively, or organically.
Next assumption -- and of course the events of July 7, I express my deep sympathy, and before that, September 11 -- have reminded us we do not live in three different worlds.
We live in one world. But that's easily said.
But we are not dealing with the implications of the one world that we are living in.
this one world cannot be based on huge pockets of exclusion, and then inclusion for some. We must now finally come to think about the premises of a truly global world, in relationship to the regime of rights and responsibilities and accountabilities that are truly global in scope. Otherwise we will be missing this open moment in history, where we have a consensus on both the form of politics and the form of economics.
What is one of these organizations to pick?
We have three critical terms: economy, and the state. I will not deal with those first two, except to say that uncritical transfer of assumptions, from one context to another, can only make for disaster. Economics taught in most of the elite universities are practically useless in my context.
My country is dominated by drug economy and a mafia.
Textbook economics does not work in my context, and I have very few recommendations from anybody as to how to put together a legal economy. The poverty of our knowledge must become the first basis of moving forward, and not imposition of the framework that works on the basis of mathematical modeling, for which I have enormous respect.
My colleagues at Johns Hopkins were among the best.
Second, instead of debating endlessly about what is the structure of the state, why don't we simplify and say, what are a series of functions that the state in the 21st century must perform?
Clare Lockhart and I are writing a book on this; we hope to share that much widely with -- and third is that we could actually construct an index to measure comparatively how well these functions that we would agree on are being performed in different places.
So what are these functions? We propose 10.
And it's legitimate monopoly of means of violence, administrative control, management of public finances, investment in human capital, provision of citizenship rights, provision of infrastructure, management of the tangible and intangible assets of the state through regulation, creation of the market, international agreements, including public borrowing, and then, most importantly, rule of law.
I won't elaborate. I hope the questions will give me an opportunity.
This is a feasible goal, basically because, contrary to widespread assumption, I would argue that we know how to do this.
Who would have imagined that Germany would be either united or democratic today, if you looked at it from the perspective of Oxford of 1943?
But people at Oxford prepared for a democratic Germany and engaged in planning.
And there are lots of other examples.
Now in order to do this -- and this brings this group -- we have to rethink the notion of capital.
The least important form of capital, in this project, is financial capital -- money.
Money is not capital in most of the developing countries.
It's just cash.
Because it lacks the institutional, organizational, managerial forms to turn it into capital. And what is required is a combination of physical capital, institutional capital, human capital -- and security, of course, is critical, but so is information.
Now, the issue that should concern us here -- and that's the challenge that I would like to pose to this group -- is again, it takes 16 years in your countries to produce somebody with a B.S. degree.
It takes 20 years to produce somebody with a Ph.D.
The first challenge is to rethink, fundamentally, the issue of the time.
Do we need to repeat the modalities that we have inherited?
Our educational systems are inherited from the 19th century.
What is it that we need to do fundamentally to re-engage in a project, that capital formation is rapid?
The absolute majority of the world's population are below 20, and they are growing larger and faster. They need different ways of being approached, different ways of being enfranchised, different ways of being skilled.
And that's the first thing.
Second is, you're problem solvers, but you're not engaging your global responsibility.
You've stayed away from the problems of corruption.
You only want clean environments in which to function.
But if you don't think through the problems of corruption, who will? You stay away from design for development.
You're great designers, but your designs are selfish. It's for your own immediate use.
The world in which I operate operates with designs regarding roads, or dams, or provision of electricity that have not been revisited in 60 years.
This is not right. It requires thinking.
But, particularly, what we need more than anything else from this group is your imagination to be brought to bear on problems the way a meme is supposed to work.
As the work on paradigms, long time ago showed -- Thomas Kuhn's work -- it's in the intersection of ideas that new developments -- true breakthroughs -- occur.
And I hope that this group would be able to deal with the issue of state and development and the empowerment of the majority of the world's poor, through this means.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: So, Ashraf, until recently, you were the finance minister of Afghanistan, a country right at the middle of much of the world's agenda.
Is the country gonna make it?
Will democracy flourish? What scares you most?
Ashraf Ghani: What scares me most is -- is you, lack of your engagement.  You asked me. You know I always give the unconventional answer.
No. But seriously, the issue of Afghanistan first has to be seen as, at least, a 10- to 20-year perspective.
Today the world of globalization is on speed. Time has been compressed.
And space does not exist for most people. But in my world -- you know, when I went back to Afghanistan after 23 years, space had expanded. Every conceivable form of infrastructure had broken down.
I rode -- traveled -- travel between two cities that used to take three hours now took 12.
So the first is when the scale is that, we need to recognize that just the simple things that are infrastructure -- it takes six years to deliver infrastructure.
In our world.
Any meaningful sort of thing.
But the modality of attention, or what is happening today, what's happening tomorrow.
Second is, when a country has been subjected to one of the most immense, brutal forms of exercise of power -- every Afghan sees the sky as a source of fear.
We were bombed practically out of existence.
Then, tens of thousands of people were trained in terrorism -- from all sides.
The United States, Great Britain, joined for instance, Egyptian intelligence service to train thousands of people in resistance and urban terrorism.
How to turn a bicycle into an instrument of terror. How to turn a donkey, a carthorse, anything.
And the Russians, equally.
So, when violence erupts in a country like Afghanistan, it's because of that legacy.
But we have to understand that we've been incredibly lucky.
I mean, I really can't believe how lucky I am here, standing in front of you, speaking.
When I joined as finance minister, I thought that the chances of my living more than three years would not be more than five percent.
Those were the risks. They were worth it.
I think we can make it, and the reason we can make it is because of the people. You see, because, I mean -- I give you one statistic.
91 percent of the men in Afghanistan, 86 percent of the women, listen to at least three radio stations a day.
In terms of their discourse, in terms of their sophistication of knowledge of the world, I think that I would dare say, they're much more sophisticated than rural Americans with college degrees and the bulk of Europeans -- because the world matters to them.
And what is their predominant concern?
Abandonment.
Afghans have become deeply internationalist.
You know, when I went back in December of 2001, I had absolutely no desire to work with the Afghan government because I'd lived as a nationalist.
And I told them -- my people, with the Americans here -- separate. Yes, I have an advisory position with the U.N.
I went through 10 Afghan provinces very rapidly.
And everybody was telling me it was a different world. You know, they engage.
They see engagement, global engagement, as absolutely necessary to the future of the ordinary people.
And the thing that the ordinary Afghan is most concerned with is -- Clare Lockhart is here, so I'll recite a discussion she had with an illiterate woman in Northern Afghanistan.
And that woman said she didn't care whether she had food on her table.
What she worried about was whether there was a plan for the future, where her children could really have a different life.
That gives me hope.
CA: How is Afghanistan going to provide alternative income to the many people who are making their living off the drugs trade?
AG: Certainly. Well, the first is, instead of sending a billion dollars on drug eradication and paying it to a couple of security companies, they should give this hundred billion dollars to 50 of the most critically innovative companies in the world to ask them to create one million jobs.
The key to the drug eradication is jobs.
Look, there's a very little known fact: countries that have a legal average income per capita of 1,000 dollars don't produce drugs.
Second, textile. Trade is the key, not aid.
The U.S. and Europe should give us a zero percent tariff.
The textile industry is incredibly mobile.
If you want us to be able to compete with China and to attract investment, we could probably attract four to six billion dollars quite easily in the textile sector, if there was zero tariffs -- would create the type of job. Cotton does not compete with opium; a t-shirt does. And we need to understand, it's the value chain.
Look, the ordinary Afghan is sick and tired of hearing about microcredit.
It is important, but what the ordinary women and men who engage in micro-production want is global access.
They don't want to sell to the charity bazaars that are only for foreigners -- and the same bloody shirt embroidered time and again.
What we want is a partnership with the Italian design firms.
Yeah, we have the best embroiderers in the world!
Why can't we do what was done with northern Italy?
With the Put Out system? So I think economically, the critical issue really is to now think through.
And what I will say here is that aid doesn't work.
You know, the aid system is broken.
The aid system does not have the knowledge, the vision, the ability.
I'm all for it; after all, I raised a lot of it.
Yeah, to be exact, you know, I managed to persuade the world that they had to give my country 27.5 billion.
They didn't want to give us the money.
CA: And it still didn't work?
AG: No. It's not that it didn't work.
It's that a dollar of private investment, in my judgment, is equal at least to 20 dollars of aid, in terms of the dynamic that it generates.
Second is that one dollar of aid could be 10 cents; it could be 20 cents; or it could be four dollars.
It depends on what form it comes, what degrees of conditionalities are attached to it.
You know, the aid system, at first, was designed to benefit entrepreneurs of the developed countries, not to generate growth in the poor countries.
And this is, again, one of those assumptions -- the way car seats are an assumption that we've inherited in governments, and doors. You would think that the US government would not think that American firms needed subsidizing to function in developing countries, provide advice, but they do. There's an entire weight of history vis-a-vis aid that now needs to be reexamined.
If the goal is to build states that can credibly take care of themselves -- and I'm putting that proposition equally; you know I'm very harsh on my counterparts -- aid must end in each country in a definable period.
And every year there must be progress on mobilization of domestic revenue and generation of the economy.
Unless that kind of compact is entered into, you will not be able to sustain the consensus.
I want to start off by saying, Houston, we have a problem.
We're entering a second generation of no progress in terms of human flight in space. In fact, we've regressed.
We stand a very big chance of losing our ability to inspire our youth to go out and continue this very important thing that we as a species have always done.
And that is, instinctively we've gone out and climbed over difficult places, went to more hostile places, and found out later, maybe to our surprise, that that's the reason we survived.
And I feel very strongly that it's not good enough for us to have generations of kids that think that it's OK to look forward to a better version of a cell phone with a video in it.
They need to look forward to exploration; they need to look forward to colonization; they need to look forward to breakthroughs.
We need to inspire them, because they need to lead us and help us survive in the future.
I'm particularly troubled that what NASA's doing right now with this new Bush doctrine to -- for this next decade and a half -- oh shoot, I screwed up.
We have real specific instructions here not to talk about politics.
What we're looking forward to is --  what we're looking forward to is not only the inspiration of our children, but the current plan right now is not really even allowing the most creative people in this country -- the Boeing's and Lockheed's space engineers -- to go out and take risks and try new stuff.
We're going to go back to the moon ... 50 years later?
And we're going to do it very specifically planned to not learn anything new.
I'm really troubled by that. But anyway that's -- the basis of the thing that I want to share with you today, though, is that right back to where we inspire people who will be our great leaders later.
That's the theme of my next 15 minutes here.
And I think that the inspiration begins when you're very young: three-year-olds, up to 12-, 14-year-olds.
What they look at is the most important thing.
Let's take a snapshot at aviation.
And there was a wonderful little short four-year time period when marvelous things happened.
It started in 1908, when the Wright brothers flew in Paris, and everybody said, "Ooh, hey, I can do that." There's only a few people that have flown in early 1908. In four years, 39 countries had hundreds of airplanes, thousand of pilots. Airplanes were invented by natural selection.
Now you can say that intelligent design designs our airplanes of today, but there was no intelligent design really designing those early airplanes.
There were probably at least 30,000 different things tried, and when they crash and kill the pilot, don't try that again.
The ones that flew and landed OK because there were no trained pilots who had good flying qualities by definition.
So we, by making a whole bunch of attempts, thousands of attempts, in that four-year time period, we invented the concepts of the airplanes that we fly today. And that's why they're so safe, as we gave it a lot of chance to find what's good.
That has not happened at all in space flying.
There's only been two concepts tried -- two by the U.S. and one by the Russians.
Well, who was inspired during that time period?
Aviation Week asked me to make a list of who I thought were the movers and shakers of the first 100 years of aviation.
And I wrote them down and I found out later that every one of them was a little kid in that wonderful renaissance of aviation.
Well, what happened when I was a little kid was -- some pretty heavy stuff too.
The jet age started: the missile age started. Von Braun was on there showing how to go to Mars -- and this was before Sputnik.
And this was at a time when Mars was a hell of a lot more interesting than it is now. We thought there'd be animals there; we knew there were plants there; the colors change, right?
But, you know, NASA screwed that up because they've sent these robots and they've landed it only in the deserts.
If you look at what happened -- this little black line is as fast as man ever flew, and the red line is top-of-the-line military fighters and the blue line is commercial air transport.
You notice here's a big jump when I was a little kid -- and I think that had something to do with giving me the courage to go out and try something that other people weren't having the courage to try.
Well, what did I do when I was a kid?
I didn't do the hotrods and the girls and the dancing and, well, we didn't have drugs in those days. But I did competition model airplanes.
I spent about seven years during the Vietnam War flight-testing airplanes for the Air Force.
And then I went in and I had a lot of fun building airplanes that people could build in their garages.
And some 3,000 of those are flying. Of course, one of them is around the world Voyager. I founded another company in '82, which is my company now.
And we have developed more than one new type of airplane every year since 1982.
And there's a lot of them that I actually can't show you on this chart.
The most impressive airplane ever, I believe, was designed only a dozen years after the first operational jet.
Stayed in service till it was too rusty to fly, taken out of service.
We retreated in '98 back to something that was developed in '56. What?
The most impressive spaceship ever, I believe, was a Grumman Lunar Lander. It was a -- you know, it landed on the moon, take off of the moon, didn't need any maintenance guys -- that's kind of cool.
We've lost that capability. We abandoned it in '72.
This thing was designed three years after Gagarin first flew in space in 1961.
Three years, and we can't do that now. Crazy.
Talk very briefly about innovation cycles, things that grow, have a lot of activity; they die out when they're replaced by something else.
These things tend to happen every 25 years.
40 years long, with an overlap. You can put that statement on all kinds of different technologies. The interesting thing -- by the way, the speed here, excuse me, higher-speed travel is the title of these innovation cycles. There is none here.
These two new airplanes are the same speed as the DC8 that was done in 1958.
Here's the biggie, and that is, you don't have innovation cycles if the government develops and the government uses it.
You know, a good example, of course, is the DARPA net.
Computers were used for artillery first, then IRS.
But when we got it, now you have all the level of activity, all the benefit from it. Private sector has to do it.
Keep that in mind. I put down innovation -- I've looked for innovation cycles in space; I found none.
The very first year, starting when Gagarin went in space, and a few weeks later Alan Shepherd, there were five manned space flights in the world -- the very first year.
In 2003, everyone that the United States sent to space was killed.
There were only three or four flights in 2003.
In 2004, there were only two flights: two Russian Soyuz flights to the international manned station. And I had to fly three in Mojave with my little group of a couple dozen people in order to get to a total of five, which was the number the same year back in 1961.
There is no growth. There's no activity. There's no nothing.
This is a picture here taken from SpaceShipOne.
This is a picture here taken from orbit.
Our goal is to make it so that you can see this picture and really enjoy that.
We know how to do it for sub-orbital flying now, do it safe enough -- at least as safe as the early airlines -- so that can be done.
And I think I want to talk a little bit about why we had the courage to go out and try that as a small company.
Well, first of all, what's going to happen next?
The first industry will be a high volume, a lot of players.
There's another one announced just last week.
And it will be sub-orbital. And the reason it has to be sub-orbital is, there is not solutions for adequate safety to fly the public to orbit. The governments have been doing this -- three governments have been doing this for 45 years, and still four percent of the people that have left the atmosphere have died.
That's -- You don't want to run a business with that kind of a safety record.
It'll be very high volume; we think 100,000 people will fly by 2020.
I can't tell you when this will start, because I don't want my competition to know my schedule.
But I think once it does, we will find solutions, and very quickly, you'll see those resort hotels in orbit.
And that real easy thing to do, which is a swing around the moon so you have this cool view. And that will be really cool.
Because the moon doesn't have an atmosphere -- you can do an elliptical orbit and miss it by 10 feet if you want.
Oh, it's going to be so much fun.
OK. My critics say, "Hey, Rutan's just spending a lot of these billionaires' money for joyrides for billionaires.
What's this? This is not a transportation system; it's just for fun."
And I used to be bothered by that, and then I got to thinking, well, wait a minute. I bought my first Apple computer in 1978 and I bought it because I could say, "I got a computer at my house and you don't.
'What do you use it for?' Come over. It does Frogger." OK.
Not the bank's computer or Lockheed's computer, but the home computer was for games.
For a whole decade it was for fun -- we didn't even know what it was for.
But what happened, the fact that we had this big industry, big development, big improvement and capability and so on, and they get out there in enough homes -- we were ripe for a new invention.
And the inventor is in this audience.
Al Gore invented the Internet and because of that, something that we used for a whole year -- excuse me -- a whole decade for fun, became everything -- our commerce, our research, our communication and, if we let the Google guys think for another couple weekends, we can add a dozen more things to the list.  And it won't be very long before you won't be able to convince kids
that we didn't always have computers in our homes.
So fun is defendable.
OK, I want to show you kind of a busy chart, but in it is my prediction with what's going to happen.
And in it also brings up another point, right here.
There's a group of people that have come forward -- and you don't know all of them -- but the ones that have come forward were inspired as young children, this little three- to 15-year-old age, by us going to orbit and going to the moon here, right in this time period.
Paul Allen, Elan Musk, Richard Branson, Jeff Bezos, the Ansari family, which is now funding the Russians' sub-orbital thing, Bob Bigelow, a private space station, and Carmack.
These people are taking money and putting it in an interesting area, and I think it's a lot better than they put it in an area of a better cell phone or something -- but they're putting it in very -- areas and this will lead us into this kind of capability, and it will lead us into the next really big thing and it will allow us to explore. And I think eventually
it will allow us to colonize and to keep us from going extinct.
They were inspired by big progress. But look at the progress that's going on after that.
There were a couple of examples here.
The military fighters had a -- highest-performance military airplane was the SR71. It went a whole life cycle, got too rusty to fly, and was taken out of service. The Concorde doubled the speed for airline travel.
It went a whole life cycle without competition, took out of service. And we're stuck back here with the same kind of capability for military fighters and commercial airline travel that we had back in the late '50s.
But something is out there to inspire our kids now.
And I'm talking about if you've got a baby now, or if you've got a 10-year-old now.
What's out there is there's something really interesting going to happen here.
Relatively soon, you'll be able to buy a ticket and fly higher and faster than the highest-performance military operational airplane. It's never happened before.
The fact that they have stuck here with this kind of performance has been, well, you know, you win the war in 12 minutes; why do you need something better?
But I think when you guys start buying tickets and flying sub-orbital flights to space, very soon -- wait a minute, what's happening here, we'll have military fighters with sub-orbital capability, and I think very soon this.
But the interesting thing about it is the commercial guys are going to go first.
OK, I look forward to a new "capitalist's space race," let's call it.
You remember the space race in the '60s was for national prestige, because we lost the first two milestones.
We didn't lose them technically. The fact that we had the hardware to put something in orbit when we let Von Braun fly it -- you can argue that's not a technical loss.
Sputnik wasn't a technical loss, but it was a prestige loss.
America -- the world saw America as not being the leader in technology, and that was a very strong thing.
And then we flew Alan Shepherd weeks after Gagarin, not months or decades, or whatever. So we had the capability.
But America lost. We lost. And because of that, we made a big jump to recover it.
Well, again, what's interesting here is we've lost to the Russians on the first couple of milestones already.
You cannot buy a ticket commercially to fly into space in America -- can't do it. You can buy it in Russia.
You can fly with Russian hardware. This is available because a Russian space program is starving, and it's nice for them to get 20 million here and there to take one of the seats.
It's commercial. It can be defined as space tourism. They are also offering a trip to go on this whip around the moon, like Apollo 8 was done.
100 million bucks -- hey, I can go to the moon.
But, you know, would you have thought back in the '60s, when the space race was going on, that the first commercial capitalist-like thing to do to buy a ticket to go to the moon would be in Russian hardware?
And would you have thought, would the Russians have thought, that when they first go to the moon in their developed hardware, the guys inside won't be Russians? Maybe it'll probably be a Japanese or an American billionaire? Well, that's weird: you know, it really is.
But anyway, I think we need to beat them again.
I think what we'll do is we'll see a successful, very successful, private space flight industry. Whether we're first or not really doesn't matter.
The Russians actually flew a supersonic transport before the Concorde.
And then they flew a few cargo flights, and took it out of service.
I think you kind of see the same kind of parallel when the commercial stuff is offered.
OK, we'll talk just a little bit about commercial development for human space flight.
This little thing says here: five times what NASA's doing by 2020. I want to tell you, already there's about 1.5 billion to 1.7 billion investment in private space flight that is not government at all -- already, worldwide. If you read -- if you Google it, you'll find about half of that money, but there's twice of that being committed out there -- not spent yet, but being committed
and planned for the next few years. Hey, that's pretty big.
I'm predicting, though, as profitable as this industry is going to be -- and it certainly is profitable when you fly people at 200,000 dollars on something that you can actually operate at a tenth of that cost, or less -- this is going to be very profitable.
I predict, also, that the investment that will flow into this will be somewhere around half of what the U.S. taxpayer spends for NASA's manned spacecraft work.
And every dollar that flows into that will be spent more efficiently by a factor of 10 to 15. And what that means is before we know it, the progress in human space flight, with no taxpayer dollars, will be at a level of about five times as much as the current NASA budgets for human space flight.
And that is because it's us. It's private industry.
You should never depend on the government to do this sort of stuff -- and we've done it for a long time. The NACA, before NASA, never developed an airliner and never ran an airline.
But NASA is developing the space liner, always has, and runs the only space line, OK. And we've shied away from it because we're afraid of it. But starting back in June of 2004, when I showed that a little group out there actually can do it, can get a start with it, everything changed after that time.
OK, thank you very much.
What I want to talk about is, as background, is the idea that cars are art.
This is actually quite meaningful to me, because car designers tend to be a little bit low on the totem pole -- we don't do coffee table books with just one lamp inside of it -- and cars are thought so much as a product that it's a little bit difficult to get into the aesthetic side under the same sort of terminology that one would discuss art.
And so cars, as art, brings it into an emotional plane -- if you accept that -- that you have to deal with on the same level you would with art with a capital A.
Now at this point you're going to see a picture of Michelangelo.
This is completely different than automobiles.
Automobiles are self-moving things, right? Elevators are automobiles.
And they're not very emotional; they solve a purpose; and certainly automobiles have been around for 100 years and have made our lives functionally a lot better in many ways; they've also been a real pain in the ass, because automobiles are really the thing we have to solve.
We have to solve the pollution, we have to solve the congestion -- but that's not what interests me in this speech.
What interests me in this speech is cars. Automobiles may be what you use, but cars are what we are, in many ways.
And as long as we can solve the problems of automobiles, and I believe we can, with fuel cells or hydrogen, like BMW is really hip on, and lots of other things, then I think we can look past that and try and understand why this hook is in many of us -- of this car-y-ness -- and what that means, what we can learn from it.
That's what I want to get to. Cars are not a suit of clothes; cars are an avatar. Cars are an expansion of yourself: they take your thoughts, your ideas, your emotions, and they multiply it -- your anger, whatever. It's an avatar.
It's a super-waldo that you happen to be inside of, and if you feel sexy, the car is sexy. And if you're full of road rage, you've got a "Chevy: Like a Rock," right?
Cars are a sculpture -- did you know this?
That every car you see out there is sculpted by hand.
Many people think, "Well, it's computers, and it's done by machines and stuff like that."
Well, they reproduce it, but the originals are all done by hand.
It's done by men and women who believe a lot in their craft.
And they put that same kind of tension into the sculpting of a car that you do in a great sculpture that you would go and look at in a museum.
That tension between the need to express, the need to discover, then you put something new into it, and at the same time you have bounds of craftsmanship.
Rules that say, this is how you handle surfaces; this is what control is all about; this is how you show you're a master of your craft.
And that tension, that discovery, that push for something new -- and at the same time, that sense of obligation to the regards of craftsmanship -- that's as strong in cars as it is in anything.
We work in clay, which hasn't changed much since Michelangelo started screwing around with it, and there's a very interesting analogy to that too.
Real quickly -- Michelangelo once said he's there to "discover the figure within," OK?
There we go, the automobile.
That was 100 years right there -- did you catch that?
Between that one there, and that one there, it changed a lot didn't it?
OK, it's not marketing; there's a very interesting car concept here, but the marketing part is not what I want to talk about here.
I want to talk about this.
Why it means you have to wash a car, what is it, that sensuality you have to touch about it? That's the sculpture that goes into it. That sensuality.
And it's done by men and women working just like this, making cars.
Now this little quote about sculpture from Henry Moore, I believe that that "pressure within" that Moore's talking about -- at least when it comes to cars -- comes right back to this idea of the mean.
It's that will to live, that need to survive, to express itself, that comes in a car, and takes over people like me.
And we tell other people, "Do this, do this, do this," until this thing comes alive.
We are completely infected. And beauty can be the result of this infectiousness; it's quite wonderful.
This sculpture is, of course, at the heart of all of it, and it's really what puts the craftsmanship into our cars.
And it's not a whole lot different, really, when they're working like this, or when somebody works like this.
It's that same kind of commitment, that same kind of beauty.
Now, now I get to the point. I want to talk about cars as art.
Art, in the Platonic sense, is truth; it's beauty, and love.
Now this is really where designers in car business diverge from the engineers.
We don't really have a problem talking about love.
We don't have a problem talking about truth or beauty in that sense.
That's what we're searching for -- when we're working our craft, we are really trying to find that truth out there.
We're not trying to find vanity and beauty.
We're trying to find the beauty in the truth.
However, engineers tend to look at things a little bit more Newtonian, instead of this quantum approach.
We're dealing with irrationalisms, and we're dealing with paradoxes that we admit exist, and the engineers tend to look things a little bit more like two and two is four, and if you get 4.0 it's better, and 4.000 is even better.
And that sometimes leads to bit of a divergence in why we're doing what we're doing.
We've pretty much accepted the fact, though, that we are the women in the organization at BMW -- BMW is a very manly type business, -- men, men, men; it's engineers.
And we're kind of the female side to that. That's OK, that's cool. You go off and be manly. We're going to be a little bit more female.
Because what we're interested in is finding form that's more than just a function.
We're interested in finding beauty that's more than just an aesthetic; it's really a truth.
And I think this idea of soul, as being at the heart of great cars, is very applicable. You all know it. You know a car when you've seen it, with soul. You know how strong this is.
Well, this experience of love, and the experience of design, to me, are interchangeable. And now I'm coming to my story.
I discovered something about love and design through a project called Deep Blue.
And first of all, you have to go with me for a second, and say, you know, you could take the word "love" out of a lot of things in our society, put the word "design" in, and it still works, like this quote here, you know. It kind of works, you know?
You can understand that. It works in truisms.
"All is fair in design and war."
Certainly we live in a competitive society.
I think this one here, there's a pop song that really describes Philippe Starck for me, you know, this is like you know, this is like puppy love, you know, this is cool right?
Toothbrush, cool.
It really only gets serious when you look at something like this. OK?
This is one substitution that I believe all of us, in design management, are guilty of.
And this idea that there is more to love, more to design, when it gets down to your neighbor, your other, it can be physical like this, and maybe in the future it will be.
But right now it's in dealing with our own people, our own teams who are doing the creating. So, to my story.
The idea of people-work is what we work with here, and I have to make a bond with my designers when we're creating BMWs.
We have to have a shared intimacy, a shared vision -- that means we have to work as one family; we have to understand ourselves that way.
There's good times; there's interesting times; and there's some stress times too.
You want to do cars, you've got to go outside.
You've got to do cars in the rain; you've got to do cars in the snow.
That's, by the way, is a presentation we made to our board of directors.
We haul their butts out in the snow, too. You want to know cars outside?
Well, you've got to stand outside to do this.
And because these are artists, they have very artistic temperaments.
All right? Now one thing about art is, art is discovery, and art is discovering yourself through your art. Right?
And one thing about cars is we're all a little bit like Pygmalion, we are completely in love with our own creations.
This is one of my favorite paintings, it really describes our relationship with cars.
This is sick beyond belief.
But because of this, the intimacy with which we work together as a team takes on a new dimension, a new meaning.
We have a shared center; we have a shared focus -- that car stays at the middle of all our relationships.
And it's my job, in the competitive process, to narrow this down.
I heard today about Joseph's death genes that have to go in and kill cell reproduction.
You know, that's what I have to do sometimes.
We start out with 10 cars; we narrow it down to five cars, down to three cars, down to two cars, down to one car, and I'm in the middle of that killing, basically.
Someone's love, someone's baby.
This is very difficult, and you have to have a bond with your team that permits you to do this, because their life is wrapped up in that too.
They've got that gene infected in them as well, and they want that to live, more than anything else.
Well, this project, Deep Blue, put me in contact with my team in a way that I never expected, and I want to pass it on to you, because I want you to reflect on this, perhaps in your own relationships.
We wanted to a do a car which was a complete leap of faith for BMW.
We wanted to do a team which was so removed from the way we'd done it, that I only had a phone number that connected me to them.
So, what we did was: instead of having a staff of artists that are just your wrist, we decided to free up a team of creative designers and engineers to find out what's the successor to the SUV phenomenon in America.
This is 1996 we did this project. And so we sent them off with this team name, Deep Blue. Now many people know Deep Blue from IBM -- we actually stole it from them because we figured if anybody read our faxes they'd think we're talking about computers.
It turned out it was quite clever because Deep Blue, in a company like BMW, has a hook -- "Deep Blue," wow, cool name.
So people get wrapped up in it. And we took a team of designers, and we sent them off to America. And we gave them a budget, what we thought was a set of deliverables, a timetable, and nothing else.
Like I said, I just had a phone number that connected me to them.
And a group of engineers worked in Germany, and the idea was they would work separately on this problem of what's the successor to the SUV.
They would come together, compare notes. Then they would work apart, come together, and they would produce together a monumental set of diverse opinions that didn't pollute each other's ideas -- but at the same time came together and resolved the problems.
Hopefully, really understand the customer at its heart, where the customer is, live with them in America. So -- sent the team off, and actually something different happened. They went other places.
They disappeared, quite honestly, and all I got was postcards.
Now, I got some postcards of these guys in Las Vegas, and I got some postcards of these guys in the Grand Canyon, and I got these postcards of Niagara Falls, and pretty soon they're in New York, and I don't know where else.
And I'm telling myself, "This is going to be a great car, they're doing research that I've never even thought about before."
Right? And they decided that instead of, like, having a studio, and six or seven apartments, it was cheaper to rent Elizabeth Taylor's ex-house in Malibu.
And -- at least they told me it was her house, I guess it was at one time, she had a party there or something.
But anyway, this was the house, and they all lived there.
Now this is 24/7 living, half-a-dozen people who'd left their -- some had left their wives behind and families behind, and they literally lived in this house for the entire six months the project was in America, but the first three months were the most intensive.
And one of the young women in the project, she was a fantastic lady, she actually built her room in the bathroom.
The bathroom was so big, she built the bed over the bathtub -- it's quite fascinating.
On the other hand, I didn't know anything about this. OK?
Nothing. This is all going on, and all I'm getting is postcards of these guys in Las Vegas, or whatever, saying, "Don't worry Chris, this is really going to be good." OK?
So my concept of what a design studio was probably -- I wasn't up to speed on where these guys were.
However, the engineers back in Munich had taken on this kind of Newtonian solution, and they were trying to find how many cup holders can dance on the head of a pin, and, you know, these really serious questions that are confronting the modern consumer.
And one was hoping that these two teams would get together, and this collusion of incredible creativity, under these incredible surroundings, and these incredibly stressed-out engineers, would create some incredible solutions.
Well, what I didn't know was, and what we found out was -- these guys, they can't even like talk to each other under those conditions.
You get a divergence of Newtonian and quantum thinking at that point, you have a split in your dialog that is so deep, and so far, that they cannot bring this together at all.
And so we had our first meeting, after three months, in Tiburon, which is just up the road from here -- you know Tiburon?
And the idea was after the first three months of this independent research they would present it all to Dr. Goschel -- who is now my boss, and at that time he was co-mentor on the project -- and they would present their results.
We would see where we were going, we would see the first indication of what could be the successive phenomenon to the SUV in America.
And so I had these ideas in my head, that this is going to be great.
I mean, I'm going to see so much work, it's so intense -- I know probably Las Vegas meant a lot about it, and I'm not really sure where the Grand Canyon came in either -- but somehow all this is going to come together, and I'm going to see some really great product.
So we went to Tiburon, after three months, and the team had gotten together the week before, many days ahead of time.
The engineers flew over, and designers got together with them, and they put their presentation together.
Well, it turns out that the engineers hadn't done anything.
And they hadn't done anything because -- kind of, like in car business, engineers are there to solve problems, and we were asking them to create a problem.
And the engineers were waiting for the designers to say, "This is the problem that we've created, now help us solve it."
And they couldn't talk about it. So what happened was, the engineers showed up with nothing.
And the engineers told the designers, "If you go in with all your stuff, we'll walk out, we'll walk right out of the project."
So I didn't know any of this, and we got a presentation that had an agenda, looked like this.
There was a whole lot of dialog.
We spent four hours being told all about vocabulary that needs to be built between engineers and designers.
And here I'm expecting at any moment, "OK, they're going to turn the page, and I'm going to see the cars, I'm going to see the sketches, I'm going to see maybe some idea of where it's going."
Dialog kept on going, with mental maps of words, and pretty soon it was becoming obvious that instead of being dazzled with brilliance, I was seriously being baffled with bullshit.
And if you can imagine what this is like, to have these months of postcard indication of how great this team is working, and they're out there spending all this money, and they're learning, and they're doing all this stuff.
I went fucking ballistic, right? I went nuts.
You can probably remember Tiburon, it used to look like this.
After four hours of this, I stood up, and I took this team apart.
I screamed at them, I yelled at them, "What the hell are you doing?
You're letting me down, you're my designers, you're supposed to be the creative ones, what the hell is going on around here?"
It was probably one of my better tirades, I have some good ones, but this was probably one of my better ones. And I went into these people; how could they take BMW's money, how could they have a holiday for three months and produce nothing, nothing?
Because of course they didn't tell us that they had three station wagons full of drawings, model concepts, pictures -- everything I wanted, they'd locked up in the cars, because they had shown solidarity with the engineers -- and they'd decided not to show me anything, in order to give the chance for problem solving a chance to start, because they hadn't realized, of course, that they couldn't do problem creating.
So we went to lunch --  And I've got to tell you, this was one seriously quiet lunch.
The engineers all sat at one end of the table, the designers and I sat at the other end of the table, really quiet.
And I was just fucking furious, furious. OK?
Probably because they had all the fun and I didn't, you know.
That's what you get furious about right?
And somebody asked me about Catherine, my wife, you know, did she fly out with me or something?
I said, "No," and it triggered a set of thoughts about my wife.
And I recalled that when Catherine and I were married, the priest gave a very nice sermon, and he said something very important.
He said, "Love is not selfish," he said, "Love does not mean counting how many times I say, 'I love you.' It doesn't mean you had sex this many times this month, and it's two times less than last month, so that means you don't love me as much.
Love is not selfish." And I thought about this, and I thought, "You know, I'm not showing love here. I'm seriously not showing love.
I'm in the air, I'm in the air without trust.
This cannot be. This cannot be that I'm expecting a certain number of sketches, and to me that's my quantification method for qualifying a team.
This cannot be."
So I told them this story. I said, "Guys, I'm thinking about something here, this isn't right. I can't have a relationship with you guys based on a premise that is a quantifiable one.
Based on a dictate premise that says, 'I'm a boss, you do what I say, without trust.'" I said "This can't be."
Actually, we all broke down into tears, to be quite honest about it, because they still could not tell me how much frustration they had built up inside of them, not being able to show me what I wanted, and merely having to ask me to trust them that it would come.
And I think we felt much closer that day, we cut a lot of strings that didn't need to be there, and we forged the concept for what real team and creativity is all about.
We put the car back at the center of our thoughts, and we put love, I think, truly back into the center of the process.
By the way, that team went on to create six different concepts for the next model of what would be the proposal for the next generation after SUVs in America.
One of those was the idea of a crossover coupes -- you see it downstairs, the X Coupe -- they had a lot of fun with that.
It was the rendition of our motorcycle, the GS, as Carl Magnusson says, "brute-iful," as the idea of what could be a motorcycle, if you add two more wheels.
And so, in conclusion, my lesson that I wanted to pass on to you, was this one here. I'm also going to steal a little quote out of "Little Prince."
There's a lot to be said about trust and love, if you know that those two words are synonymous for design.
I had a very, very meaningful relationship with my team that day, and it's stayed that way ever since.
And I hope that you too find that there's more to design, and more towards the art of the design, than doing it yourself.
It's true that the trust and the love, that makes it worthwhile.
Thanks so much.
At the break, I was asked by several people about my comments about the aging debate.
And this will be my only comment on it.
And that is, I understand that optimists greatly outlive pessimists.
What I'm going to tell you about in my 18 minutes is how we're about to switch from reading the genetic code to the first stages of beginning to write the code ourselves.
It's only 10 years ago this month when we published the first sequence of a free-living organism, that of haemophilus influenzae.
That took a genome project from 13 years down to four months.
We can now do that same genome project in the order of two to eight hours.
So in the last decade, a large number of genomes have been added: most human pathogens, a couple of plants, several insects and several mammals, including the human genome.
Genomics at this stage of the thinking from a little over 10 years ago was, by the end of this year, we might have between three and five genomes sequenced; it's on the order of several hundred.
We just got a grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation to sequence 130 genomes this year, as a side project from environmental organisms.
So the rate of reading the genetic code has changed.
But as we look, what's out there, we've barely scratched the surface on what is available on this planet.
Most people don't realize it, because they're invisible, but microbes make up about a half of the Earth's biomass, whereas all animals only make up about one one-thousandth of all the biomass.
And maybe it's something that people in Oxford don't do very often, but if you ever make it to the sea, and you swallow a mouthful of seawater, keep in mind that each milliliter has about a million bacteria and on the order of 10 million viruses.
Less than 5,000 microbial species have been characterized as of two years ago, and so we decided to do something about it.
And we started the Sorcerer II Expedition, where we were, as with great oceanographic expeditions, trying to sample the ocean every 200 miles.
We started in Bermuda for our test project, then moved up to Halifax, working down the U.S. East Coast, the Caribbean Sea, the Panama Canal, through to the Galapagos, then across the Pacific, and we're in the process now of working our way across the Indian Ocean.
It's very tough duty; we're doing this on a sailing vessel, in part to help excite young people about going into science.
The experiments are incredibly simple.
We just take seawater and we filter it, and we collect different size organisms on different filters, and then take their DNA back to our lab in Rockville, where we can sequence a hundred million letters of the genetic code every 24 hours.
And with doing this, we've made some amazing discoveries.
For example, it was thought that the visual pigments that are in our eyes -- there was only one or two organisms in the environment that had these same pigments.
It turns out, almost every species in the upper parts of the ocean in warm parts of the world have these same photoreceptors, and use sunlight as the source of their energy and communication.
From one site, from one barrel of seawater, we discovered 1.3 million new genes and as many as 50,000 new species.
We've extended this to the air now with a grant from the Sloan Foundation.
We're measuring how many viruses and bacteria all of us are breathing in and out every day, particularly on airplanes or closed auditoriums.
We filter through some simple apparatuses; we collect on the order of a billion microbes from just a day filtering on top of a building in New York City.
And we're in the process of sequencing all that at the present time.
Just on the data collection side, just where we are through the Galapagos, we're finding that almost every 200 miles, we see tremendous diversity in the samples in the ocean.
Some of these make logical sense, in terms of different temperature gradients.
So this is a satellite photograph based on temperatures -- red being warm, blue being cold -- and we found there's a tremendous difference between the warm water samples and the cold water samples, in terms of abundant species.
The other thing that surprised us quite a bit is these photoreceptors detect different wavelengths of light, and we can predict that based on their amino acid sequence.
And these vary tremendously from region to region.
Maybe not surprisingly, in the deep ocean, where it's mostly blue, the photoreceptors tend to see blue light.
When there's a lot of chlorophyll around, they see a lot of green light.
But they vary even more, possibly moving towards infrared and ultraviolet in the extremes.
Just to try and get an assessment of what our gene repertoire was, we assembled all the data -- including all of ours thus far from the expedition, which represents more than half of all the gene data on the planet -- and it totaled around 29 million genes.
And we tried to put these into gene families to see what these discoveries are: Are we just discovering new members of known families, or are we discovering new families?
And it turns out we have about 50,000 major gene families, but every new sample we take in the environment adds in a linear fashion to these new families.
So we're at the earliest stages of discovery about basic genes, components and life on this planet.
When we look at the so-called evolutionary tree, we're up on the upper right-hand corner with the animals.
Of those roughly 29 million genes, we only have around 24,000 in our genome.
And if you take all animals together, we probably share less than 30,000 and probably maybe a dozen or more thousand different gene families.
I view that these genes are now not only the design components of evolution.
And we think in a gene-centric view -- maybe going back to Richard Dawkins' ideas -- than in a genome-centric view, which are different constructs of these gene components.
Synthetic DNA, the ability to synthesize DNA, has changed at sort of the same pace that DNA sequencing has over the last decade or two, and is getting very rapid and very cheap.
Our first thought about synthetic genomics came when we sequenced the second genome back in 1995, and that from mycoplasma genitalium.
And we have really nice T-shirts that say, you know, "I heart my genitalium."
This is actually just a microorganism.
But it has roughly 500 genes.
Haemophilus had 1,800 genes.
And we simply asked the question, if one species needs 800, another 500, is there a smaller set of genes that might comprise a minimal operating system?
So we started doing transposon mutagenesis.
Transposons are just small pieces of DNA that randomly insert in the genetic code.
And if they insert in the middle of the gene, they disrupt its function.
So we made a map of all the genes that could take transposon insertions and we called those "non-essential genes."
But it turns out the environment is very critical for this, and you can only define an essential or non-essential gene based on exactly what's in the environment.
We also tried to take a more directly intellectual approach with the genomes of 13 related organisms, and we tried to compare all of those, to see what they had in common.
And we got these overlapping circles. And we found only 173 genes common to all 13 organisms.
The pool expanded a little bit if we ignored one intracellular parasite; it expanded even more when we looked at core sets of genes of around 310 or so.
So we think that we can expand or contract genomes, depending on your point of view here, to maybe 300 to 400 genes from the minimal of 500.
The only way to prove these ideas was to construct an artificial chromosome with those genes in them, and we had to do this in a cassette-based fashion.
We found that synthesizing accurate DNA in large pieces was extremely difficult.
Ham Smith and Clyde Hutchison, my colleagues on this, developed an exciting new method that allowed us to synthesize a 5,000-base pair virus in only a two-week period that was 100 percent accurate, in terms of its sequence and its biology.
It was a quite exciting experiment -- when we just took the synthetic piece of DNA, injected it in the bacteria and all of a sudden, that DNA started driving the production of the virus particles that turned around and then killed the bacteria.
This was not the first synthetic virus -- a polio virus had been made a year before -- but it was only one ten-thousandth as active and it took three years to do.
This is a cartoon of the structure of phi X 174.
This is a case where the software now builds its own hardware, and that's the notions that we have with biology.
People immediately jump to concerns about biological warfare, and I had recent testimony before a Senate committee, and a special committee the U.S. government has set up to review this area.
And I think it's important to keep reality in mind, versus what happens with people's imaginations.
Basically, any virus that's been sequenced today -- that genome can be made.
And people immediately freak out about things about Ebola or smallpox, but the DNA from this organism is not infective.
So even if somebody made the smallpox genome, that DNA itself would not cause infections.
The real concern that security departments have is designer viruses.
And there's only two countries, the U.S. and the former Soviet Union, that had major efforts on trying to create biological warfare agents.
If that research is truly discontinued, there should be very little activity on the know-how to make designer viruses in the future.
I think single-cell organisms are possible within two years.
And possibly eukaryotic cells, those that we have, are possible within a decade.
So we're now making several dozen different constructs, because we can vary the cassettes and the genes that go into this artificial chromosome.
The key is, how do you put all of the others?
We start with these fragments, and then we have a homologous recombination system that reassembles those into a chromosome.
This is derived from an organism, deinococcus radiodurans, that can take three million rads of radiation and not be killed.
It reassembles its genome after this radiation burst in about 12 to 24 hours, after its chromosomes are literally blown apart.
This organism is ubiquitous on the planet, and exists perhaps now in outer space due to all our travel there.
This is a glass beaker after about half a million rads of radiation.
The glass started to burn and crack, while the microbes sitting in the bottom just got happier and happier.
Here's an actual picture of what happens: the top of this shows the genome after 1.7 million rads of radiation.
The chromosome is literally blown apart.
And here's that same DNA automatically reassembled 24 hours later.
It's truly stunning that these organisms can do that, and we probably have thousands, if not tens of thousands, of different species on this planet that are capable of doing that.
After these genomes are synthesized, the first step is just transplanting them into a cell without a genome.
So we think synthetic cells are going to have tremendous potential, not only for understanding the basis of biology but for hopefully environmental and society issues.
For example, from the third organism we sequenced, Methanococcus jannaschii -- it lives in boiling water temperatures; its energy source is hydrogen and all its carbon comes from CO2 it captures back from the environment.
So we know lots of different pathways, thousands of different organisms now that live off of CO2, and can capture that back.
So instead of using carbon from oil for synthetic processes, we have the chance of using carbon and capturing it back from the atmosphere, converting that into biopolymers or other products.
We have one organism that lives off of carbon monoxide, and we use as a reducing power to split water to produce hydrogen and oxygen.
Also, there's numerous pathways that can be engineered metabolizing methane.
And DuPont has a major program with Statoil in Norway to capture and convert the methane from the gas fields there into useful products.
Within a short while, I think there's going to be a new field called "Combinatorial Genomics," because with these new synthesis capabilities, these vast gene array repertoires and the homologous recombination, we think we can design a robot to make maybe a million different chromosomes a day.
And therefore, as with all biology, you get selection through screening, whether you're screening for hydrogen production, or chemical production, or just viability.
To understand the role of these genes We're trying to modify photosynthesis to produce hydrogen directly from sunlight.
Photosynthesis is modulated by oxygen, and we have an oxygen-insensitive hydrogenase that we think will totally change this process.
We're also combining cellulases, the enzymes that break down complex sugars into simple sugars and fermentation in the same cell for producing ethanol.
Pharmaceutical production is already under way in major laboratories using microbes.
The chemistry from compounds in the environment is orders of magnitude more complex than our best chemists can produce.
I think future engineered species could be the source of food, hopefully a source of energy, environmental remediation and perhaps replacing the petrochemical industry.
Let me just close with ethical and policy studies.
We delayed the start of our experiments in 1999 until we completed a year-and-a-half bioethical review as to whether we should try and make an artificial species.
Every major religion participated in this.
It was actually a very strange study, because the various religious leaders were using their scriptures as law books, and they couldn't find anything in them prohibiting making life, so it must be OK. The only ultimate concerns were biological warfare aspects of this, but gave us the go ahead to start these experiments for the reasons we were doing them.
Right now the Sloan Foundation has just funded a multi-institutional study on this, to work out what the risk and benefits to society are, and the rules that scientific teams such as my own should be using in this area, and we're trying to set good examples as we go forward.
These are complex issues.
Except for the threat of bio-terrorism, they're very simple issues in terms of, can we design things to produce clean energy, what developing countries can do and provide through various simple processes.
Thank you very much.
Hello voice mail, my old friend.
I've called for tech support again.
I ignored my boss's warning. I called on a Monday morning.
Now it's evening, and my dinner first grew cold, and then grew mold.
I'm still on hold. I'm listening to the sounds of silence.
I don't think you understand. I think your phone lines are unmanned.
I punched every touch tone I was told, but I've still spent 18 hours on hold.
It's not enough your software crashed my Mac, and it constantly hangs and bombs -- it erased my ROMs!
Now the Mac makes the sounds of silence.
In my dreams I fantasize of wreaking vengeance on you guys.
Say your motorcycle crashes.
Blood comes gushing from your gashes.
With your fading strength, you call 9-1-1 and you pray for a trained MD. But you get me.
And you listen to the sounds of silence.
Thank you. Good evening and welcome to: "Spot the TED Presenter Who Used to Be a Broadway Accompanist."
When I was offered the Times column six years ago, the deal was like this: you'll be sent the coolest, hottest, slickest new gadgets.
Every week, it'll arrive at your door.
You get to try them out, play with them, evaluate them until the novelty wears out, before you have to send them back, and you'll get paid for it. You can think about it, if you want.
So, I've always been a technology nut, and I absolutely love it.
The job, though, came with one small downside, and that is, they intended to publish my email address at the end of every column.
And what I've noticed is -- first of all, you get an incredible amount of email.
If you ever are feeling lonely, get a New York Times column, because you will get hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of emails.
And the email I'm getting a lot today is about frustration.
People are feeling like things -- Ok, I just had an alarm come up on my screen. Lucky you can't see it.
People are feeling overwhelmed. They're feeling like it's too much technology, too fast.
It may be good technology, but I feel like there's not enough of a support structure.
There's not enough help.
There's not enough thought put into the design of it to make it easy and enjoyable to use.
One time I wrote a column about my efforts to reach Dell Technical Support, and within 12 hours, there were 700 messages from readers on the feedback boards on the Times website, from users saying, ""Me too, and here's my tale of woe."
I call it "software rage."
And man, let me tell you, whoever figures out how to make money off of this frustration will -- Oh, how did that get up there? Just kidding.
Ok, so why is the problem accelerating? And part of the problem is, ironically, because the industry has put so much thought into making things easier to use.
I'll show you what I mean.
This is what the computer interface used to look like, DOS.
Over the years, it's gotten easier to use.
This is the original Mac operating system.
Reagan was President. Madonna was still a brunette.
And the entire operating system -- this is the good part -- the entire operating system fit in 211 k.
You couldn't put the Mac OS X logo in 211 k!
So the irony is, that as these things became easier to use, a less technical, broader audience was coming into contact with this equipment for the first time.
I once had the distinct privilege of sitting in on the Apple call center for a day.
The guy had a duplicate headset for me to listen to.
And the calls that -- you know how they say, "Your call may be recorded for quality assurance?"
Uh-uh. Your call may be recorded so that they can collect the funniest dumb user stories and pass them around on a CD.
Which they do.
And I have a copy.
It's in your gift bag. No, no.
With your voices on it!
So, some of the stories are just so classic, and yet so understandable.
A woman called Apple to complain that her mouse was squeaking.
Making a squeaking noise.
And the technician said, "Well, ma'am, what do you mean your mouse is squeaking?"
She says, "All I can tell you is that it squeaks louder, the faster I move it across the screen."
And the technician's like, "Ma'am, you've got the mouse up against the screen?"
She goes, "Well, the message said, 'Click here to continue.'"  Well, if you like that one -- how much time have we got?
Another one, a guy called -- this is absolutely true -- his computer had crashed, and he told the technician he couldn't restart it, no matter how many times he typed "11."
And the technician said, "What? Why are you typing 11?"
He said, "The message says, 'Error Type 11.'"  So, we must admit that some of the blame falls squarely at the feet of the users.
But why is the technical overload crisis, the complexity crisis, accelerating now?
In the hardware world, it's because we the consumers want everything to be smaller, smaller, smaller.
but our fingers are essentially staying the same size.
So it gets to be more and more of a challenge.
Software is subject to another primal force: the mandate to release more and more versions.
When you buy a piece of software, it's not like buying a vase or a candy bar, where you own it.
and every year, they say, "We've added more features, and we'll sell it to you for $99."
I know one guy who's spent $4,000 just on Photoshop over the years.
And software companies make 35 percent of their revenue from just these software upgrades.
I call it the Software Upgrade Paradox -- which is that if you improve a piece of software enough times, you eventually ruin it.
I mean, Microsoft Word was last just a word processor in, you know, the Eisenhower administration.
But what's the alternative? Microsoft actually did this experiment.
They said, "Well, wait a minute. Everyone complains that we're adding so many features.
Let's create a word processor that's just a word processor: Simple, pure; does not do web pages, is not a database."
And it came out, and it was called Microsoft Write.
And none of you are nodding in acknowledgment, because it died.
It tanked. No one ever bought it.
I call this the Sport Utility Principle.
People like to surround themselves with unnecessary power, right?
They don't need the database and the website, but they're like, "Well, I'll upgrade, because, I might, you know, I might need that someday."
So the problem is: as you add more features, where are they going to go?
Where are you going to stick them? You only have so many design tools.
You can do buttons, you can do sliders, pop-up menus, sub-menus.
But if you're not careful about how you choose, you wind up with this.
This is an un-retouched -- this is not a joke -- un-retouched photo of Microsoft Word, the copy that you have, with all the toolbars open.
You've obviously never opened all the toolbars, but all you have to type in is this little, teeny window down here.
And we've arrived at the age of interface matrices, where there are so many features and options, you have to do two dimensions, you know: a vertical and a horizontal. You guys all complain about how Microsoft Word is always bulleting your lists and underlining your links automatically.
The off switch is in there somewhere.
I'm telling you -- it's there.
Part of the art of designing a simple, good interface, is knowing when to use which one of these features.
So, here is the log-off dialogue box for Windows 2000.
There are only four choices, so why are they in a pop-up menu?
It's not like the rest of the screen is so full of other components that you need to collapse the choices.
They could have put them all out in view.
Here's Apple's take on the exact same dialogue box.
Thank you -- yes, I designed the dialogue box. No, no.
Already, we can see that Apple and Microsoft have a severely divergent approach to software design.
Microsoft's approach to simplicity tends to be: let's break it down; let's just make it more steps.
There are these "wizards" everywhere.
And you know, there's a new version of Windows coming out this fall.
If they continue at this pace, there's absolutely no telling where they might wind up.
"Welcome to the Type a Word Wizard." Ok, I'll bite. Let's click "Next" to continue.
From the drop-down menu, choose the first letter you want to type. Ok.
So there is a limit that we don't want to cross. So what is the answer?
How do you pack in all these features in a simple, intelligent way?
I believe in consistency, when possible, real-world equivalents, trash can folder, when possible, label things, mostly.
But I beg of the designers here to break all those rules if they violate the biggest rule of all, which is intelligence. Now what do I mean by that?
I'm going to give you some examples where intelligence makes something not consistent, but it's better.
If you are buying something on the web, you're supposed to put in your address, and you're supposed to choose what country you're from, ok?
There are 200 countries in the world. We like to think of the Internet as a global village.
I'm sorry; it's not one yet.
It's mainly like, the United States, Europe, and Japan.
So why is "United States" in the "U"s?
You have to scroll, like, seven screensful to get to it.
Now, it would be inconsistent to put "United States" first, but it would be intelligent. This one's been touched on before, but why in God's name do you shut down a Windows PC by clicking a button called "Start?"
Here's another pet one of mine: you have a printer.
Most of the time, you want to print one copy of your document, in page order, on that printer.
So why in God's name do you see this every time you print?
It's like a 747 shuttle cockpit.
And one of the buttons at the bottom, you'll notice, is not "Print."
Now, I'm not saying that Apple is the only company who has embraced the cult of simplicity.
Palm is also, especially in the old days, wonderful about this.
I actually got to speak to Palm when they were flying high in the '90s, and after the talk, I met one of the employees.
He says, "Nice talk." And I said, "Thank you. What do you do here?"
He said, "I'm a tap counter." I'm like, "You're a what?"
He goes, "Well Jeff Hawkins, the CEO, says, 'If any task on the Palm Pilot takes more than three taps of the stylus, it's too long, and it has to be redesigned.' So I'm the tap counter."
So, I'm going to show you an example of a company that does not have a tap counter.
This is Microsoft Word.
Ok, when you want to create a new blank document in Word -- it could happen.
You go up to the "File" menu and you choose "New."
Now, what happens when you choose "New?" Do you get a new blank document?
You do not.
On the opposite side of the monitor, a task bar appears, and somewhere in those links -- by the way, not at the top -- somewhere in those links is a button that makes you a new document.
Ok, so that is a company not counting taps.
You know, I don't want to just stand here and make fun of Microsoft ...
Yes, I do.
The Bill Gates song!
I've been a geek forever and I wrote the very first DOS.
I put my software and IBM together; I got profit and they got the loss.
I write the code that makes the whole world run.
I'm getting royalties from everyone.
Sometimes it's garbage, but the press is snowed.
You buy the box; I'll sell the code.
Every software company is doing Microsoft's R&amp;D.
You can't keep a good idea down these days.
Even Windows is a hack. We're kind of based loosely on the Mac.
So it's big, so it's slow. You've got nowhere to go. I'm not doing this for praise.
I write the code that fits the world today.
Big mediocrity in every way.
We've entered planet domination mode.
You'll have no choice; you'll buy my code.
I am Bill Gates and I write the code.
But actually, I believe there are really two Microsofts.
There's the old one, responsible for Windows and Office.
They're dying to throw the whole thing out and start fresh, but they can't.
They're locked in, because so many add-ons and other company stuff locks into the old 1982 chassis.
But there's also a new Microsoft, that's really doing good, simple interface designs.
I liked the Media Center PC.
I liked the Microsoft SPOT Watch.
The Wireless Watch flopped miserably in the market, but it wasn't because it wasn't simply and beautifully designed.
But let's put it this way: would you pay $10 a month to have a watch that has to be recharged every night like your cell phone, and stops working when you leave your area code?
So, the signs might indicate that the complexity crunch is only going to get worse.
So is there any hope?
The screens are getting smaller, people are illuminating, putting manuals in the boxes, It's funny -- when Steve Jobs came back to Apple in 1997, after 12 years away, it was the MacWorld Expo -- he came to the stage in that black turtleneck and jeans, and he sort of did this. The crowd went wild, but I had just seen -- I'm like, where have I seen this before? I had just seen the movie "Evita" --
with Madonna, and I'm like, you know what? I've got to do one about Steve Jobs.
It won't be easy. You'll think I'm strange.
When I try to explain why I'm back, after telling the press Apple's future is black.
You won't believe me.
All that you see is a kid in his teens who started out in a garage with only a buddy named Woz.
You try rhyming with garage!
Don't cry for me, Cupertino.
The truth is, I never left you.
I know the ropes now, know what the tricks are.
I made a fortune over at Pixar.
Don't cry for me, Cupertino. I've still got the drive and vision.
I still wear sandals in any weather. It's just that these days, they're Gucci leather.
Thank you. So Steve Jobs had always believed in simplicity and elegance and beauty.
And the truth is, for years I was a little depressed, because Americans obviously did not value it, because the Mac had three percent market share, Windows had 95 percent market share -- people did not think it was worth putting a price on it.
So I was a little depressed. And then I heard Al Gore's talk, and I realized I didn't know the meaning of depressed.
But it turns out I was wrong, right? Because the iPod came out, and it violated every bit of common wisdom.
Other products cost less; other products had more features, they had voice recorders and FM transmitters.
The other products were backed by Microsoft, with an open standard, not Apple's propriety standard.
But the iPod won -- this is the one they wanted.
The lesson was: simplicity sells.
And there are signs that the industry is getting the message.
This is a little company that's done very well with simplicity and elegance.
The Sonos thing -- it's catching on.
I've got just a couple examples.
Physically, a really cool, elegant thinking coming along lately.
When you have a digital camera, how do you get the pictures back to your computer?
Well, you either haul around a USB cable, or you buy a card reader and haul that around.
Either one, you're going to lose.
What I do is, I take out the memory card, and I fold it in half, revealing USB contacts.
I just stick it in the computer, offload the pictures, put it right back in the camera. I never have to lose anything.
Here's another example.
Chris, you're the source of all power. Will you be my power plug?
Chris Anderson: Oh yeah. DP: Hold that and don't let go.
You might've seen this, this is Apple's new laptop. This the power cord. It hooks on like this.
And I'm sure every one of you has done this at some point in your lives, or one of your children.
You walk along -- and I'm about to pull this onto the floor. I don't care. It's a loaner.
Here we go. Whoa! It's magnetic -- it doesn't pull the laptop onto the floor.
In my very last example -- I do a lot of my work using speech recognition software.
And I'll just -- you have to be kind of quiet because the software is nervous.
Speech recognition software is really great for doing emails very quickly; period.
Like, I get hundreds of them a day; period.
And it's not just what I dictate that it writes down; period.
I also use this feature called voice macros; period.
Correct "dissuade."
Ok, this is not an ideal situation, because it's getting the echo from the hall and stuff.
The point is, I can respond to people very quickly by saying a short word, and having it write out a much longer thing.
So if somebody sends me a fan letter, I'll say, "Thanks for that."
And conversely, if somebody sends me hate mail -- which happens daily -- I say, "Piss off."
So that's my dirty little secret. Don't tell anyone.
So the point is -- this is a really interesting story.
This is version eight of this software, and do you know what they put in version eight?
No new features. It's never happened before in software!
The company put no new features.
They just said, "We'll make this software work right." Right?
Because for years, people had bought this software, tried it out -- 95 percent accuracy was all they got, which means one in 20 words is wrong -- and they'd put it in their drawer. And the company got sick of that, so they said, "This version, we're not going to do anything, but make sure it's darned accurate."
And so that's what they did. This cult of doing things right is starting to spread.
So, my final advice for those of you who are consumers of this technology: remember, if it doesn't work, it's not necessarily you, ok?
It could be the design of the thing you're using.
Be aware in life of good design and bad design.
And if you're among the people who create this stuff: Easy is hard.
Pre-sweat the details for your audience. Count the taps.
Remember, the hard part is not deciding what features to add, it's deciding what to leave out.
And best of all, your motivation is: simplicity sells.
CA: Bravo. DP: Thank you very much.
CA: Hear, hear!
Kurt Andersen: Like many architects, David is a hog for the limelight but is sufficiently reticent -- or at least pretends to be -- that he asked me to question him rather than speaking.
In fact what we're going to talk about, I think, is in fact a subject that is probably better served by a conversation than an address.
And I guess we have a bit of news clip to precede.
Dan Rather: Since the September 11th attack on the World Trade Center, many people have flocked to downtown New York to see and pay respects at what amounts to the 16-acre burial ground.
Now, as CBS's Jim Axelrod reports, they're putting the finishing touches on a new way for people to visit and view the scene.
Jim Axelrod: Forget the Empire State Building or the Statue of Liberty.
There's a new place in New York where the crowds are thickest -- Ground Zero.
Tourist: I've taken my step-daughter here from Indianapolis.
This was -- out of all the tourist sites in New York City -- this was her number-one pick.
JA: Thousands now line up on lower Broadway.
Tourist: I've been wanting to come down here since this happened.
JA: Even on the coldest winter days.
To honor and remember.
Tourist: It's reality, it's us. It happened here.
This is ours.
JA: So many, in fact, that seeing has become a bit of a problem.
Tourist: I think that people are very frustrated that they're not able to get closer to see what's going on.
JA: But that is about to change.
In record time, a team of architects and construction workers designed and built a viewing platform to ease the frustration and bring people closer.
Man: They'll get an incredible panorama and understand, I think more completely, the sheer totality of the destruction of the place.
JA: If you think about it, Ground Zero is unlike most any other tourist site in America.
Unlike the Grand Canyon or the Washington Monument, people come here to see what's no longer there.
David Rockwell: The first experience people will have here when they see this is not as a construction site but as this incredibly moving burial ground.
JA: The walls are bare by design, so people can fill them with their own memorials the way they already have along the current perimeter.
Tourist: From our hearts, it affected us just as much.
JA: The ramps are made of simple material -- the kind of plywood you see at construction sites -- which is really the whole point.
In the face of America's worst destruction people are building again.
Jim Axelrod, CBS News, New York.
KA: This is not an obvious subject to be in the sensuality segment, but certainly David you are known as -- I know, a phrase you hate -- an entertainment architect.
Your work is highly sensual, even hedonistic.
DR: I like that word.
KA: It's about pleasure -- casinos and hotels and restaurants.
How did the shock that all of us -- and especially all of us in New York -- felt on the 11th of September transmute into your desire to do this thing?
DR: Well the truth of the matter is, post-September 11th, I felt myself in the role originally -- first of all as someone who lives in Tribeca and whose neighborhood was devastated, and as someone who works less than a mile from there -- that I was in the role of forcing 100 people who work with me in my firm, to continue to have the same level of enthusiasm about creating the places we had been creating.
In fact we're finishing a book which is called "Pleasure," which is about sensual pleasure in spaces.
But I've got to tell you -- it became impossible to do that.
We were really paralyzed.
And I found myself the Friday after September 11th -- two days afterwards -- literally unable to motivate anyone to do anything.
We gave the office a few days off.
And in discussing this with other architects, we had seen people saying in the press that they should rebuild the towers as they were -- they should rebuild them 50 stories taller.
And I thought it was astonishing to speculate, as if this were a competition, on something that was such a fresh wound.
And I had a series of discussions -- first with Rick Scofidio and Liz Diller, who collaborated with us on this, and several other people -- and really felt like we had to find relevance in doing something.
And that as people who create places, the ultimate way to help wasn't to pontificate or to make up scenarios, but to help right now.
So we tried to come up with a way, as a group, to have a kind of design SWAT team.
And that was the mission that we came up with.
KA: Were you conscious of suddenly -- as a designer whose work is all about fulfilling wants -- suddenly fulfilling needs?
DR: Well what I was aware of was, there was this overwhelming need to act now.
And we were asked to participate in a few projects before this.
There was a school, PS 234, that had been evacuated down at Ground Zero.
They moved to an abandoned school.
We took about 20 or 30 architects and designers and artists, and over four days -- it was like this urban barn-raising -- to renovate it, and everyone wanted to help.
It was just extraordinary.
Tom Otterness contributed, Maira Kalman contributed and it became this cathartic experience for us.
KA: And that was done, effectively, by October 8 or something?
DR: Yeah.
KA: Obviously, what you faced in trying to do something as substantial as this project -- and this is only one of four that you've designed to surround the site -- you must have run up against the incredibly byzantine, entrenched bureaucracy and powers that be in New York real estate and New York politics.
DR: Well, it's a funny thing.
We finished PS 234, and had dinner with a small group.
I was actually asked to be a committee chair on an AIA committee to rebuild.
And I sat in on several meetings.
And there were the most circuitous grand plans that had to do with long-term infrastructure and rebuilding the entire city.
And the fact is that there were immediate wounds and needs that needed to be filled, and there was talk about inclusion and wanting it to be an inclusive process.
And it wasn't an inclusive group.
So we said, what is -- KA: It was not an inclusive group?
DR: It was not an inclusive group.
It was predominantly a white, rich, corporate group that was not representative of the city.
KA: Shocking.
DR: Yeah, surprising.
So Rick and Liz and Kevin and I came up with the idea.
The city actually approached us.
We first approached the city about Pier 94.
We saw how PS 234 worked.
The families -- the victims of the families -- were going to this pier that was incredibly dehumanizing.
KA: On the Hudson River?
DR: Yeah. And the city actually -- through Tim Zagat initially, and then through Christyne Nicholas, then we got to Giuliani -- said, "You know we don't want to do anything with Pier 94 right now, but we have an observation platform for the families down at Ground Zero that we'd like to be a more dignified experience for the families, and a way to protect it from the weather."
So I went down there with Rick and Liz and Kevin, and I've got to say, it was the most moving experience of my life.
It was devastating to see the simple plywood platform with a rail around it, where the families of the victims had left notes to them.
And there was no mediation between us and the experience.
There was no filter.
And I remembered on September 11th, on 14th Street, the roof of our building -- we can see the World Trade Towers prominently -- and I saw the first building collapse from a conference room on the eighth floor on a TV that we had set up.
And then everyone was up on the roof, so I ran up there.
And it was amazing how much harder it was to believe in real life than it was on TV.
There was something about the comfort of the filter and how much information was between us and the experience.
So seeing this in a very simple, dignified way was a very powerful experience.
So we went back to the city and said we're not particularly interested in the upgrade of this as a VIP platform, but we've spent some time down there.
At the same time the city had this need.
They were looking for a solution to deal with 30 or 40 thousand people a day who were going down there, that had nowhere to go.
And there was no way to deal with the traffic around the site.
So dealing with it is just an immediate master plan.
There was a way -- there had to be a way -- to get people to move around the site.
KA: But then you've got to figure out a way -- we will skip over the insanely tedious process of getting permits and getting everybody on board -- but simply funding this thing.
